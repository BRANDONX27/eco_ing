	  South Korea is an excellent example and comparison model. Like Mexico, it is a country
	moderately populated (70 million inhabitants), as well as an ally and a highly
	dependent on the United States.
	<br>
         At the end of World War II in 1945, the country had barely 1,000 graduates
	university students and the illiteracy rate was 78%. By the end of the Korean War, in
	July 1953, South Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world, with a GDP per capita
	of approximately 79 dollars. Almost fifty years later, the Asian country has become
	one of the only two members of its region - the other is Japan - to be part of the
	Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). As of today, it is the 11th
	the world's largest economy; has a per capita GDP of $ 30,000 (double that of
	Mexico); more than 70% of their young people graduate from university and qualify at the top of the
	Program for the International Evaluation of Students (PISA of the OECD) and other exams

	such as semiconductor memory chips, electronic displays and cell phones

	The history of Korean development begins immediately after the end of the Second World War
	World, with an intense education campaign that raised the literacy of an average	
	It was less than 50% to virtually 100% in 5 years. In the fifties, first as a
	effort during the war and then as part of the recovery program, help
	from the United States, of around one billion dollars per year (double the
	domestic income of South Korea), as well as military construction, maintenance and
	supply contracts, provided the base from where the small companies
	Koreans began to evolve into the corporate chaebol1 giants of today.
	Hyundai, for example, started as a supply transport company and then as
	contractor to build North American military bases. LG first emerged as a provider
	of resin and chemicals during the war.
	Because virtually everything had to be imported, its economy was constantly
	I was in a trade deficit. This gave rise to import substitution policies
	under which small Korean businesses were encouraged, through the imposition of
	high tariffs and granting preferential loans, so that they begin to manufacture or
	at least to process in the country items such as toothpaste, cement, sugar, flour, rice
	milled, textiles and other consumer products.
	Some of these chaebol like Samsung, which at that time was a small
	marketing and rice milling, had their takeoff with this process. This activity of
	Import substitution was accompanied by significant investments for the improvement of
	the infrastructure devastated during the war. At the same time, important measures were taken
	to improve the savings rate of Koreans that at the beginning of the sixties was less than 4%
	of GNP. Interest rates on term deposits rose from 15 to 30%. The tall ones
	tariffs and limits on the quantity and types of goods that could be imported or purchased by
	individual consumers, kept consumer prices relatively high. To the
	At the same time, credit to consumers was almost non-existent except for the so-called
	alternative markets or usurers where the interests could be prohibitive and lacking protection
	any. In this way savings at the national level rose and would eventually reach a
	30% of GNP (Woo, page 160). The result of this sum of factors, between 1953 and 1962, was that the
	economy grew at 4.5% annual percent; Not a miracle yet, but nothing despicable either.
	In 1961, General Park Chung-Hee carried out a military coup that
	would become president of South Korea. Having observed Japan, he had learned what

		Mexican economy has grown at a steady pace and has been attracting a number each time

	• Mexico boasts of being the 14th largest economy in the world with a GDP growing at
         4% per year.
	<br>
	• GDP per capita is greater than almost all developing economies.
	<br>
	• Debt, as a percentage of GDP, is less than 50% (lower than the US and the EU).
	<br>
	• Mexico operates with a very low trade deficit, with imports and exports
	balanced
	<br>
	• There is a low government deficit as a percentage of GDP.
	<br>
	• Comparatively little external debt.
	<br>
	• The Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI) is better than many
	comparable economies.
	<br>
	• Investment in infrastructure has doubled since 2003.

	• Spending on education is the 5th highest, according to the Organization for Cooperation and the
         Economic Development (OECD).

	As a result, Mexico is like a global corporation with the danger of presenting an excess
	of trust, while in reality it is losing market share and becoming more
	vulnerable to unexpected competition and external shocks. These problems are
	composed of the enormous competitive challenge coming from Asia. As an example, participation
	of China's non-energy exports to the United States has grown by 800%, while
	that Mexico's exports to the US border have barely doubled.
	Countries like South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Poland have also surpassed Mexico. This
	way, despite some positive achievements, the country is now facing two major
	issues: will it be able to increase its competitiveness, to match that of the most
	dynamics of emerging markets and ensure an improvement in growth and
	productivity, as well as raising the standard of living of its citizens? and if so, how would
